# Autonomous Agriculture
 Automated Garden Information System

 My name is Nathaniel King and I'm very interested in sustainability. This is a project I've been working on with the goal of automating as much of the information side of agriculture as possible.

 I've completed a few different stages of the project:

 1. Integrate soil temperature sensor into excel sheet containing calendar of plant specific temperature data
 2. Convert software into a pthon webapp, eventually run on raspberry pi (in progress)

I have a YouTube channel called Total Veganic Futurism: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAqBLkDrMsOQne8CkS79JMg
